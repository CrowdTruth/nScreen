==N-screen==

This is a web-based application that allows multiple people to go to a URL in a browser, drag and drop 
programmes between each other, and drag and drop programmes to a 'TV' (XBMC installation) to play them. 
It can be used to find and watch on-demand TV when 'together but apart'. You can see a video here:

The setup requires an EJabberd installation with Bosh enabled, and various simple APIs to the data. The 
actual client is very simple - javascript and HTML with strophe and jquery - it works in modern 
browsers. The eJabberd server can be on a separate machine. 

==Installation==

See install.txt and ejabberd_setup.txt
